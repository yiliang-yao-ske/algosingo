*Program for array rotation*


METHOD 1 (Using temp array)



Input arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], d = 2, n =7
1) Store d elements in a temp array
   temp[] = [1, 2]
2) Shift rest of the arr[]
   arr[] = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7]
3) Store back the d elements
   arr[] = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2]
Time complexity : O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(d)



METHOD 2 (Rotate one by one)

leftRotate(arr[], d, n)
start
  For i = 0 to i < d
    Left rotate all elements of arr[] by one
end
To rotate by one, store arr[0] in a temporary variable temp, move arr[1] to arr[0], arr[2] to arr[1] â€¦and finally temp to arr[n-1]

Let us take the same example arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], d = 2
Rotate arr[] by one 2 times
We get [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1] after first rotation and [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2] after second rotation.

Time complexity : O(n*d)
Auxiliary Space : O(1)


METHOD 3 (A Juggling Algorithm)
This is an extension of method 2. Instead of moving one by one, divide the array in different sets
where number of sets is equal to GCD of n and d and move the elements within sets.
If GCD is 1 as is for the above example array (n = 7 and d =2), then elements will be moved within one set only, we just start with temp = arr[0] and keep moving arr[I+d] to arr[I] and finally store temp at the right place.

Here is an example for n =12 and d = 3. GCD is 3 and
Time complexity : O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
